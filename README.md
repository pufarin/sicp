# General Information

* Installed Scheme according to the information provided on the [MIT/GNU Scheme website!](https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/) on a Linux distro. Your Package Manager probably also offers Scheme.
* Typing **mit-scheme** in the terminal will open the REPL.
* For running and saving code to file I am using emacs. I wanted to avoid emacs, but the other options are not that good.

### Emacs Commands
* **C** &rarr; Ctrl ; **M** &rarr; Alt
* Open the ***.scm** file via the GUI
* Open a vertical or horizontal new pane/buffer using the command **C-x 3** or **C-x 2**
* To switch between panes **C-x o**
* Kill a buffer **C-x k** + buffer name
* Cancel command **C-g**
* To open the REPL **M-x** + run-scheme 

### Scheme
* One line comment use **;**
* Multiline comment use **#|** and **|#**
